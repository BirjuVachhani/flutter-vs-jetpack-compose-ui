This repository contains UI code for both Flutter and Android Jetpack-Compose. Use `getStartedScreen.kt` for Android Jetpack-Compose and `GetStartedScreen.dart` for Flutter project. This repository doen't contain whole projects for flutter and jetpack compose, instead it has independent UI files that can be added to respective existing fresh project

Note that this both files can be added to respective projects to run and test the behaviour. Don't forget to put `banner.png` in respective resource folders to build and run the projects.
